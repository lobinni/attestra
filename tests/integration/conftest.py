"""Deployment helpers for the live suite.

`ContractFactory.deploy()` cannot bind this contract on a hosted network,
for two reasons that are both in the tooling rather than in the contract:

  1. It derives the ABI with `get_contract_schema_for_code`, which
     `genlayer_py` refuses outright on any chain that is not localnet
     ("Contract schema is not supported on this network").
  2. That same call hexes source as ASCII only. A source file may contain
     non-ASCII documentation, so the call can raise UnicodeEncodeError before
     it ever reaches the network — on localnet too.

Neither is a reason to strip characters out of the source. The schema
the tests actually want is the one the CHAIN reports for the deployed
address, which `gen_getContractSchema` returns happily, so that is what
is used here. Binding to the deployed contract's own schema is also the
more honest thing to test against: it describes what is on chain rather
than what the local file would compile to.

# contract bug, and worse, aborting there STRANDS a transaction that was
# already submitted and is still being processed.

# polling and submission alike. Re-broadcasting is safe: the raw
# transaction is already signed, so its nonce and hash are fixed, and a
# node that saw the first copy answers the second with the same hash
# instead of executing anything twice.

# error — a revert, a bad parameter — is a real answer and is raised
